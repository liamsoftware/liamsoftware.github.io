    <h4>Parenting Strategies for Small Children</h4>

    <p>The below strategies have served me well when parenting so far (until 5 years old). The older my child gets, then I have found the strategies to work better. Taking the time to research this topic and learn the strategies has made my life less stressful, made me less angry and improved my relationship and time I have with my son. These strategies are outlined in the book How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen by Joanna Faber and Julie King. <br><br>
      
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t dictate to them – they will not respond well to being told what they cannot do. As an adult, I really dislike being told what I can and cannot do. Children dislike this too.   </li>
      <li>Describe their feeling to them – they don’t understand what they are feeling so you can help put words to the feelings. Acknowledging and describing feelings can take the sting out of the situation or temper. And often there is no further action required to remedy the tantrum.  </li>
      <li>Do problem solving together – this is an important skill that we want to develop in our children, the ability to go through the problem solving process will be something that they will use all throughout life. </li>
      <li>Describe how you feel and what you see rather than dictating to them. E.G. “I don’t like when people colour on the floor” or “I see a coat thrown on the floor”. </li>
      <li>Give descriptive praise rather than evaluative praise. Evaluative praise puts pressure to perform again in the future, so we want to disassociate the task or achievement from their core character. </li>
  </ul>
    
  These strategies are outlined in the book How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen by Joanna Faber and Julie King. <br><br>
    I highly recommend reading the book. It’s a small investment for an improved home.  <br><br><br><br>
