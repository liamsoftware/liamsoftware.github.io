    <p class="quote">“Quality is pride of workmanship” - W. Edwards Deming</p>    

    <p>Problem solving is a skill that we can use in all areas of our lives, and it is an especially useful process to follow when dealing with programming problems. I find it far more beneficial to think through (and write down) the problem I am dealing with, working through solutions mentally before I try to work on the code. This was useful when learning programming initially and is now useful in my job at times when I’m dealing with unfamiliar code or changes to the codebase. I’ll outline the steps that I follow here.<br><br>
      
    <strong>1. Define the problem.</strong> Just one line, describing whatever the problem is. E.g I want to check if a word is a palindrome (spelt the same backwards).<br><br>
    
    If you are writing professional code, then the advice here is to write a unit test. Known as Test Driven Development. I rarely do this.<br><br>
        
    <strong>2. Plan.</strong> Now that we know what the problem is, we can come up with ideas on how we can solve it. This will be our plan. E.g. I need to create the given word backwards, then I want to check if it matches the given word. To get the word backwards, I want to loop through each char from the end of the word to create a new word.<br><br>
        
    It’s better to write the solution in English (or whatever non programming language) first. We can convert that to code in the next step. So people will mix English with code and call it pseudocode. I usually just write out the steps in English. <br><br>
        
    <strong>3. Implement</strong> - Write the code. This is where we translate the English into actual code. We can include logging here as we go to ensure we are on the right track. That can be cleaned up later.<br><br>
        
    <strong>4. Test/Validate</strong> - its best to use some unit tests but you can also use the log statements included in the previous step. Run the program and see what happens.<br><br>

    <strong>5. Iterate</strong> - clean up your code. Refactor it to make it more efficient. Redo testing and validation to ensure you are not breaking the core functionality of the code. <br><br>
        
    Problem solving can be fun, and can also be very difficult. I find it much easier to problem solve in the evening time and after a good nights sleep. I also like to have some snacks for a longer problem solving session. <br><br>

    You can apply the process for problem solving to many other areas of your life. It’s a key skill that children can learn too (this is the main premise of the Apply TV+ children’s programme called Helpsters, which is a fun show). It’s also the basis of Deming’s iterative management process called Plan Do Check Act, although that is applied to continuous improvement. Which is what we are doing when problem solving, continuously making our solution better. <br><br>

    I could often benefit from applying the problem solving  process to all sorts of other areas of my life. I fail to do so, but in hindsight I can see how much beneficial the using the process could be, even just as an exercise which would help with my stress level. <br><br>

    I hope you can take this process and make use of it. </p><br><br><br><br>
