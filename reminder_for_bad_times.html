    <h4>A Reminder for When Things Are Not Going According to Plan</h4>

    <p>I often get times when work may not be going how I want, or my performance on the soccer team is not good, or my relationship with someone is not going well, or something else that is affecting me - these situations tend to drive me to bad habits. I can use them as excuses to eat unhealthy or drink alot alcohol or watch too much TV. I use it as an excuse to let the bad habits take over and ignore the fact that I can choose to do something more productive. <br><br><strong style="color: rgb(200, 0, 0);">When something happens outside of my control, then I should do something else more productive, I should work on the things that I am in control of.</strong> <br><br>
      
    <ul>
      <li>Write about what is happening - put it onto paper, how you feel, what you can do, and then leave it there.</li>
      <li>Do something work related - anything will do.</li>
      <li>Make a nice meal.</li>
      <li>Clean up the house, reorganise an area.</li>
      <li>Go for a walk.</li>
      <li>Do some weights - this is often the most effective option which relieves stress and reclaims some control.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Time will pass and a way will be found around the problem, or will not be found. But do not let that affect your mind. Do not let the outcome or potential outcome drive you to bad habits. You cannot use the prospect as an excuse for bad habits. Stay commit to your goals and the things in your life that you are in control of and can influence. <br><br><br><br>
