    <h4>Leetcode Marginal Gains Improvement System</h4>

    <p>Almost all programming interviews that I have participated in have involve an exercise to test programming skills. This is sometimes performed on an online assessment system or else with an engineer from the hiring company. These exercises can be stressful and difficult to solve with someone watching your solution be put together. The purpose of the test is to examine how you problem solve. You can prepare for these tests. You want to be in the problem solving frame of mind before interviewing to be able to pass this level of the interview process.  <br><br>

    <p>Leetcode is an online programming problem solving system. It provides you with sample problems to solve and also gives you an interface to enter your solution. Your solution will be assess for correctness and performance.   <br><br>

    <p>The problems provided by Leetcode fall into easy, medium, and hard. Categories of questions vary greatly including arrays, data structures and algorithms. Finding solutions to one problem may help with solving others. I expect that the more problems you attempt to solve, then the better you become at other problems.   <br><br>

    <p>On starting Leetcode, my confidence of being a programmer has been greatly hit. I struggle to solve the easy problems on the website. Taking my solution and seeing it fail some of the tests is extremely disheartening. So much so that I am driven to eat unhealthy and give up on ever being able to get another job in tech. From reading others experiences with going through the hiring process, the only option is to “grind” and experience the pain of being poor at solving the problems at first. Eventually you will come across some similar problems and you will be thinking algorithmically. You will solve some of the problems. Unfortunately I have not yet experienced this after trying several times to improve at Leetcode questions, eventually giving up and not trying to get another job.   <br><br>

    <p>I need to keep trying to get better at problem solving each day. Start with the easy questions, try to solve one on paper, if you cannot, look up the solution and understand why they used that technique and how it works. I need to have some commitment to the process of improving and trying to get a little bit better at Leetcode problem solving every day.  <br><br><br><br>
