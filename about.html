    <p class="quote">Charming spot. Inspiring prospects. Let’s go. - Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot</p>    

    <p>Right, here we are then. I have finally set up a place for writing down my thoughts.<br><br>
      
    Who am I to be writing about software? No one really, just a lucky software developer working in Europe. I have 5 years of experience. Not all of my career has been working as a developer. I spent 6 years working in various non tech roles before returning to education and then getting a job in development, which I have enjoyed, albeit without much financial success. I believe that my experience gives me some credibility to comment on tech, which I will do so on this website. Among other topics.<br><br>
        
    I develop communications software for a medium sized corporation. Working mostly with Java, deploying to an on prem hosted Kubernetes platform. It’s been interesting. <br><br>
        
    I will be writing about working in tech on this website. Including languages and platforms, dealing with other people, customers, or anything else I think is useful to write about.<br><br>
        
    This static website is hosted on Linode and served by an Nginx web server. You can see how easy that is to do from the Linode guide: <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/set-up-web-server-host-website/">https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/set-up-web-server-host-website/</a><br><br>
        
    This website is intended to check a box - one that has been in my head for years; To blog about tech from time to time. I’m hoping that it will help me grow, that is the idea. <br><br>
        
    Thank you for visiting this site.</p><br><br><br><br>
